Final Summary 

My project is the Arduino Sports game which enables a player to moniter his/her swinging of a model baseball bat. The game identifies the position of the bat (with a vertical and horizontal axis designation) when a player starts and finishes swinging the bat. I plan to add a pitch (ball) intersecting with the bat to create a game that will enable a player to monitor his/her swinging of the bat with the goal of hitting homeruns. 

The gyroscope outputs the positioning of the bat on the LCD panel of the vertical, horizontal and impact of the swing. I plan to add a pitch/positioning of a ball so that the game can record how many homeruns/strikes that the user makes within 10 tries. As you could see, the 3D parts came out well for the bat. The Arduino was designed to be located on the top of the bat and I had hoped to put the gyroscope inside the case that I designed and have the LCD panel on the barrel of the bat so that the user could monitor his/her swing. I ran out of time to figure out how to attach everything to the bat so instead I put the LCD panel and gyroscope on the same breadboard that is connected to the Adruino.  I had to change the conditionals for the gyroscope's positions because originally I had the the gyroscope freely moving. Instead, I had to connect the gyroscope to the breadboard (see the conditionals). I would like to have more time to try and to make the game wireless and also add a pitch.

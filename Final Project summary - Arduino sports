Final Summary 

The Adrduino Sports game is completed. Although I did not add a goal to my game, I got the gyroscope outputting the position-ings on the LCD panel. Originally I wanted to add the pitch to the game and the object was supposed to record how many homeruns/strikes that the user can get 10 tries. As you could see, the 3d parts came out good for the bat and the Arduino was supposed to be the on the top of the bat and gyroscope wouldve been in the case. The LCD would've been on the barrel of the bat. I had to change the conditionals for the gyroscope's positions because I connected it to the breadboard (see the code). I would have like to have more time to try and to make the game wireless.

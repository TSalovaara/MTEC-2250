1. Who is it for?
-8-14 years, the northeastern United States
-8-14 years, Europe
-8-14 years, Central Asia

2. What is it for?
-It's a sports game for youth and kids to learn teamwork and basic physics about baseball, basketball, and American football.  It's a better version of Wii Sports.  It's an entertainment for kids and families to have better relationships. It encourages physical activity and visual creativity.  It will help to reduce childhood obesity.

3. When will it be used?
	1.
		-In the northeastern United States, the majority of the population will be able to afford the game.  No major modifications will be made to tailor the product for this population.
		-In Europe, living spaces tend to be smaller (at least in cities).  As a result, the product will be smaller than that for the northeastern United States.  Europe uses different outlets, forcing the need for different power adapters for the devices.
		-In Central Asia, the environment is quite rural with significantly less access to modern technology than in the previously cited regions.  As a result, the product will be designed in such a way to minimize cost to myself and therefore to the consumer market.  In addition, because of a scarcity of power, the devices will need to be energy-efficient.	
	2. Materials and sensors
		-In the northeastern United States, a plastic baseball bat with LEDs to switch between different modes.  The football and basketball will be similar to  a nerf ball.  This is a cautionary for kids to be safe while playing the game.  The sensors would be 3 LEDs showing which colors are for which games.  For example, orange will be for basketball, and yellow for American football.  A gyroscope will be crucial for measuring the angles of motion.  It will also help people to learn basic physics from an early stage.  The OLED will be used to display the rules of the game.  On the other hand, the LCD is stronger.   
		-In both Europe and Central Asia, the materials and sensors will be the same as those in the northeastern United States.  The LCD screen will be used in these regions to display the game.


4. Why do we need this?
	This game will bring families together and build bonds in the northeastern United States.  It also will promote physical activity as opposed to activity on a computer or smartphone screen.  However, in Europe and Central Asia, the game will open new possibilities for young kids that will be interested in electronics someday.  Moreover, it will help Central Asia in terms of technology growth.  Europeans and Central Asians will be exposed to a “new” version of football.

5. How does it work?

Step-By-Step instructions for Baseball

1) Put the band on the Bat
2) Turn it on 
3) User will see Rules of the game on the screen
4) Hit the button to continue
5) LED screen will display pitch (at random)
6)countdown
7) User tries to swing 
8)Output Displays "Home Run" or "Strike"

Step-By-Step instructions for Basketball

1) Put the band on the Basketball
2) Turn it on 
3) User will see Rules of the game on the screen
4) Hit the button to continue
5) LED screen will display an image of a shot (at random)
6) Countdown
7) User makes a shooting motion
8)Output Displays "Airball" or "Basket!"


	1. this is a link to a game that I want to build off from. Backyard sports is a game that people can be active while having fun. My game will be the same except for the QR codes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNrnaMpoRdA
